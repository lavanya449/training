definition:
A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable. Once a reference is initialized with a variable, either the variable name or the reference name may be used to refer to the variable.


program:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
  
int main()
{
  int x = 10;
  int& ref = x;
  ref = 20;
  cout << "x = " << x << endl ;
  x = 30;
  cout << "ref = " << ref << endl ;
  
  return 0;
}
